        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Becky Wanjala. I'm in my final year here on campus, but I recently got the opportunity to take a short course in  (PLP). And guess what? It's all thanks to a scholarship I was awarded!

            This scholarship focuses on offering technology-related courses, and I couldn't be more thrilled about it. PLP is something I've been interested in for a while now, and having the chance to dive into it is just amazing. I believe it's going to be incredibly beneficial not only for my academic journey but also for my future career prospects..</p>
